## About The Project

Green Greet is a platform that encourages and supports sustainable initiatives and projects through the use of blockchain technology. The main function of the platform is to allow users to publish their projects as NFTs, which contain information about the project and the author's credibility. Other users can then contribute to these projects through Escrow payments, which are only released when the project is fully funded.
